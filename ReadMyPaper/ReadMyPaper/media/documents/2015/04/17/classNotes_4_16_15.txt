EUROPEAN DEBT CRISIS

Euro
	Problems
		- No control of interest Rates
			- problem for Ireland because of higher inflation
		- Fixed Exchange Rates & strong currency
			- Alright when you're a strong central member of eurozone
			- Issue when you're a peripheral member
				- Can't make themselves competitive by devaluing currency
					- Became a big issue with Greece
				- Subject to growth goals & deficit/debt limits
					- How did Greece get around deficit/debt?
						- Lie about the state of Gov't books
						- New regime came in and stopped lying
						- Got good deals on debt because they're in euro zone

	Benefits
		- Open Access to European Market
		- More Secure/SafeDebt
			- Lower cost to Finance Debt
			- Yield spread between German(safe) and Greek(risky) Bonds dropped a lot when Greece was admitted to Euro
		- Stable Currency with Fixed ExRate within the Eurozone
		- Subsidies

US Financial Crisis
	- Countries bailout banks
	- countries run stimulus packages
	- leads to deficits and debt
	- Greec starts to have issues servicing debt due to increased interest rates
	- spread between german & greek bonds increases
	- Flight to safety as people look to get safer money
		- US is safe so people flocked to buy US Bonds
		- Greece wasn't safe so people didn't buy Greek Bonds
	- Credit Rating agencies begin cutting Greek ratings
	- Cost to finance Greek debt continues to increase

Austerity Measures
	- Increase taxes and/or decrease gov't spending
	- This causes issues
		- Politically unpopular
		- Keynesian Economics --> Negative AD Shock
		- These issues caused riots, protests, etc
	- Greece starts gettings loans/bailouts
		- IMF, ECB, and EC form TROICA
		- Austerity measures are a string attached

Back to Greece
	- Eventually Greek bonds reach "Junk" status around 2010
	- Greece revisits its estimates for 2009 budget in 2010
		- Originally was a 12.7% deficit
		- then austerity measures
		- deficit increased to 13.6%
		- Thought it may even be revised further up
	- Greece cuts the face value of its debt
		- causes some banking issues
		- Cyprus needs a bailout (highly exposed to greek debt)
	- Greece has deep seeded structural issues in its economy
		- Welfare state
		- Issues with budgets
			- Ex. 
				- Greek National Railroad Company had employee salaries 4x that of ticket sales
				- Greek retirement age is 58
				- Greek pension was ~96% of final 5 years of earnings
				- Government pensions
				- Greeks don't pay taxes
				- Bribery is very popular in Greece
					- Doctors and Tax collectors are two most highly bribed professions

Ireland
	- Booming before joining Eurozone
	- Struggled with inability to set interest rates once they joined the eurozone
		- They had higher inflation than the rest of europe
	- They were booming but Europe was running low interest rates so boom increased
	- Capital flowed in very quickly
	- Suffered from speculation after Greece meltdown
	- Between 2000 and 2008 inflation averaged ~10%
		- Higher than rest of Europe

- optimally the currency area would have business cycle synchronization
- Optimal Currency areas can be smaller than a country
	- US is probably not an optimal currency
		- i.e. CT vs TX
- EU wants itself to be an optimal currency area
	- if so it would be self inforcing
	- No one would benefit from leaving
	- doesn't really work perfectly
		- illustrated by periphery countries

GREAT RECESSION

Bear Sterns 
	- Bought by JP Morgan Chase
	- Heavy loans from Fed (~$30B)
		- strange because Fed doesn't regulate Bear Sterns (SEC does)
		- collateral used by JPMC was Bear Sterns assets
		- created panic

Lehman Brothers
	- Failed
	- Was gonna be bought by Barclays bought deal fell through
		- rest of financial sector would have needed to soak up a lot of toxic assets
	- Barclays would have been forced to guarantee all Lehman assets by Monday
		- Ran into issues with British legal code
		- couldn't get a shareholder vote so they needed a waiver from UK SEC
			- Waived DENIED ==> Lehman fails

WAMU
	- Failed
	- sold to JP Morgan Chase ($1.9B)
		- some goes to stock holders, mostly debt holders
		- not nearly made full on the deal
		- Debt holders and stock holders wiped out
	- Under FDIC

Wachovia
	- Under FDIC
	- Fail
	- Judged systematically important
		- Protect debt holders
		- auction held for assets 
		- Citigroup and Wells Fargo bid
			- Citigroup awarded the right to buy Wachovia since their bid was "better"
			- Citigroup bid cost less for FDIC
			- Citigroup bid was complex and took awhile to take hold
		- Later a tax law changes
			- Wells Fargo comes back with a better bid
			- Essentailly Wells Fargo was offering to outright buy Wachovia
			- This wasn't exactly legal (lawsuit settled out of court for ~$1B)

AIG
	-Failed
		- Credit Default Swaps (CDSs)
			- insurance contracts for any assets, even if you don't own it
	- Bailed out because they were systemically important insurance company
	- Insurance side of business was still profitable
	- Investment side not so much
	- Insurance is still done at the state level in US (strange)
		- subsidiaries all have nice capital cushions
		- umbrella company however can't just take out that money for other reasons

Money Markets (MM Mutual Funds)
	- Liquidity Problems
		- $1 a share for many years
		- considering the need to devalue
		- they have no federal guarantee though
	- Not allowed to borrow money
		- Treasury used it exchange stabilization fund to 
	  	  provide "FDIC Type" insurance to those who wanted it
	  	  	- Did NOT lose money
	  	  	- Now illegal (wasn't then)

Europe
	- NOTE: Not common in US but elsewhere in world 
	  many people make deposits/loans in foreign currency
	- Liquidity problems in dollars
		- Central Bank Liquidity Swap
			- i.e. Fed will take your Euros for dollars
				- enter into a future repurchase agreement with fixed exchange rate
				- fed assumes no exchange rate risk
			- Fed, ECB, Canda, Japan have permanent standing billateral agreements of this type

Fannie & Freddie
	- Government Sponsored Organizations (GSOs)
	- Buy mortgages from banks so banks have cash to lend out for more mortgages
		- Many people took this to mean the gov't guarantees their debt
			- Not necessarily true but ended up happening with bailout
	- Gov't started it then spins it off to be owned by stockholders
	- F&F were borrowing short term on commercial paper market
		- Commercial paper = uncollaterallized IOUs
		- People assumed these IOUs were backed by gov't
		- led to really low interest rates being given to them
		- made mortgage loans at higher rates
		- made money on the difference
	- Housing market dips so they stop getting great interest rates
	- Short term debt and long term assets means constant debt rollover
	- This lead to a problem when they ran out of liquidity
	- Put into full conservatorship by government
